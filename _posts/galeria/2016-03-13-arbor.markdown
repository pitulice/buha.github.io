excerpt: Trees are the largest living  being on Earth as well as being the longest lived lifeforms. Trees are aware of their neighbors and they communicate, collaborate or compete with each other through their huge underground root nets. They host birds, insects and their tops were the playground of human ancestors. For millions of years, strong bonds have formed between trees and humans, and this is perhaps the reason why I feel attracted not only to studying and climbing them, but photographing them as well.
