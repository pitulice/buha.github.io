Mosaic religions claim absolute morality. As we will see in the following paper **1)** the moral code God gave Moses was not new at the time and **2)** morality derived from God's actions through the Bible are inconsistent with this moral code. 

##The Ten Commandments were not new

It is natural to think that there have been moral laws before the Ten Commandments received by Moses. The Bible claims it as-well: Cain is punished for murder and lie (Genesis 4:9-12), Abraham is congratulated by God for keeping His (yet unwritten) commandments (Genesis 26:5), the Israelites are supposed to keep the Sabbath (Exodus 16:4), Canaanites are supposed to be punished because of their idolatrous practices (Leviticus 18:21) etc. 

External evidences for this are numerous. The Book of the Dead, known to be in circulation since 1550 B.C. in Ancient Egypt, is a collection of funerary texts. Chapter 125 presents a confession of someone called N, excepts of which are reproduced below:

>I have not told lies  
I have not killed anyone  
I have not slept with a man’s wife  
I have not robbed, I have not stolen[^1]
I have not been quick tempered  
I have not been violent  
I have not been disloyal  
I have not selected just for my good  
I have not multiplied voice in speech  
I have not been turbulent  
I have not masturbated  
I have done no injustice to people, nor have I maltreated an animal[^1]

It is pointless I think to go further than just mentioning the  moral or social laws that existed even on paper at the time, namely Hammurabi, Lipit-Ishtar, Eshnunna, and Ur-nammu, followed by the neo-Babylonian Laws, Assyrian Laws, and Hittite Laws. In all these, one can find identical or at least parallel statements with the Ten Commandments.

##The-literal-God's moral inconsistency

Throughout the Old Testament we read stories of odious crimes and acts of injustice done either by God or by His people at His mighty command.

One kind of crimes are those commanded all throughout the Old Testament by God but that are not among the Ten Commandments. Some examples might be sacrificing to gods other than Himself (Exodus 22:20, Numbers 25:1-9), false prophecy (Deuteronomy 13:1-10), Sabbath breaking (Exodus 31:14), blasphemy (Leviticus 24:10-16 and the death of Jesus). Most of the time the death was supposed to be provoked by stoning and in many instances innocent children or people were killed only because God commanded them to conquer their land or a certain city and mercilessly kill everything in it.

Another kind of crimes are those that God himself or His angelic servants are said to have provoked: God's angel kills all Egypt's first-borns (Exodus 12:29-30), another angel kills 185.000 army soldiers (2 Kings 19:35), Lot's wife for looking back at the destruction of her home and supposedly feeling sorry (Genesis 19:26), the 10 scouts sent to explore the promised land that came back with reports of a land being difficult to conquer (Numbers 14:36-38), Korah, Dathan,  Abiram and their families, 250 Israelites – followers of Korah, 14700 israelites complaining about Korah related assasinations and so on and so forth. Blood, death, plague, fire, drowning, sulphur rains, animals devouring, alive burying – and remember: this is the same God that commanded “Thou shalt not kill” did.

Now, since I am here, I must the scene where 42 children were killed by two bears because they mocked at Elisha's bald head (2 Kings 2:23-24). This goes far beyond any other, I think, because it's about killing innocents that didn't even know of such a rule of not calling a God's prophet “bald” because there wasn't any. Even if it had been, who would think of punishing children by killing him? A person that still tries to fit this episode into its views and tries to find a supernatural explanation for why it is morally right that it happened this way, should be seriously be reconsidering at this point its world-view and faith since it goes against any instinct (paternal/maternal) and as we shall see – against any morally universal law. Believers and theologians like to postulate the existance of a hidden knowledge that God might possess that we don't, and according to that knowledge, or according to his omniscience or omnipotence or whatever, these crimes might be explainable. Left without any further arguments many resort to the promise they all have that they will have that knowledge in the Day of Judgement. Against such claims however, it is not even worth debating because they are not falsifiable. Anybody could come up with stories about fairies in their garden that only show up to people who believe in them. The fairies could even have omnipotence but what does it matter if their very existence is not falsifiable? Note that I do not say "proven" but falsifiable as in Karl Popper's falsifiability principle. Despite all this,  most of the believers and theologians will try to excuse these murders and their numbers by whatever means and this is how mosaic religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) spread a very dangerous idea: the reflex to justify crime.

God is therefore self-inconsistent. It would be totally wrong to take His morality as absolute, perfect and applicable in our society.

##Mathematical and biological universalism

It is becoming increasingly clear that other animals think and act like us. They share aspects like sympathy, empathy, they help others in need, reciprocity, desire of reconciliation after fights and overall the willingness to follow social rules[^2]. In terms of cognitive capacities, some of them have gotten as far as thinking about hidden agents[^3], meta-tool usage[^4], and some animals exhibit self-consciousness[^5]. At the biological level it seems that there is an underlying universalism (formally called convergent evolution) regarding the method the evolution has shaped organs to serve functions and systems in across species. Animals that see have developed mostly two eyes to better appreciate velocities or two ears to better form a 3D sound image of the surroundings instead of just one. Vertebrates and Octopuses have developed the camera eye independently[^6]. Bats and cetaceans use sound mapping. Bats fly as birds but both have developed wings independently. It seems that there is such a thing as an optimal solution to no matter what biological challenge species have encountered throughout time.

Further on, looking at the primitive laws of mathematics, it is well known that using extremely simple recursive functions, one can draw trees, mountains, broccoli and cauliflowers, different herbs, snowflakes etc. This is because the information that has to be carried is minimum when carrying a simple recursive function.

A simple example from physics is that of refracted light that takes the shortest path in terms of time and not distance.

Societies have been successfully described with all sort of chaotic mathematical models. All these show that even at a very high level an organism follows simple rules like the minimization of costs.

As Frans de Waal shows, morality is a bottom-up process, resulting from complex social interactions. Fairness and “Equal pay” in cappuchin monkeys is exactly what we would expect from a moral being. Reconciliation after fights is exactly what we would expect from an animal that some people say it possesses morality. Helping distressed individuals is exactly what we would expect from a moral human being. All these are found in certain monkeys and apes. Bernd Heinrich has seen friendships in ravens – the sort of friendships between friends that seemed to have met after years-long period and who have had a good time doing tricks on the sky without any other expectancies or without food or benefits for survival being involved[^7]. Michael Shermer has found that following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals including cetaceans, elephants alongside great apes:

Attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group[^8].

One could say that the explanation for all this is the fact that we see them and interpret these acts in human language or thought but we can't know whether these animals have a moral sense for real. I would argue exactly the opposite: because we are capable of empathy and because we recognize them, they are of the same nature as ours so there is no anthropomorphizing process in the middle. We could possibly observe moral behaviour in animals that we don't have as humans without knowing that it's moral behaviour. But as far as we share common rules, we will immediately identify them as morality.

##Moral universalism

Throughout the history there has been a noisy debate between moral absolutism and relativism.

Moral absolutism, if not sustained by some sophisticated mystical arguments, it cannot stand, simply because if we look around different cultures have different opinions and moral laws in certain aspects. On top of that, the mosaic concept of absolute morality is not divine and the application of the rules is circumstantial even when God Himself is said to have applied them.

Moral relativism on the other side is, for some, the only remaining alternative. However, taken per se it fails to respond to very simple questions like “Is there any to be blamed for the Nazis crimes?” or “Can moral relativism account for community rules (like laws) if right and wrong are defined by each person for themselves?”.

Moral universalism, in the form presented here as arising altogether with biological features in convergent fashion, can answer questions from both sides:

- It can account for the existence of identical rules in different communities. The existence of identical rules, traditionally explained by moral absolutism, is very easily explained through moral universalism even cross-species. The examples given above on animal reconciliation, empathy, sharing and even friendship show that we as humans share with them moral rules as we share with distant isolated tribes or humans from long ago or yet to be born.
- It can account for cultural differences in morality

##Conclusion

Humans as social animals have the tendency to follow social rules and these social rules are in fact what we ought, what we are forbidden, what it would be desirable or not to do – in short, moral rules. Morality is something evolving bottom-up through biological and social evolution rather than something that comes (and we showed it isn't the case) from God. Convergent evolution of morality in many species shows that the universality we see in morality is a result of some primitive function like cost minimalization much like the shape of all trees is governed by a simple fractal function. It doesn't even matter which one is it, it simply matters that you can find cross-species moral values like friendship, the value of helping uncapable individuals, the sharing of resources, fairness, loyalty and so on. And because moral universalism can explain both differences and similarities between human and animal communities across time and across the planet it is reasonable to conclude that the traditional debate between moral relativism and absolutism can come to an end because neither of them are able to answer the questions arising from recent studies in human and animal sociology.

The whole point of the Bible is to show us the road to salvation because upon some unfortunate event and by some magical sin transfer, all the humanity became morally corrupt; isn't it? As it had been shown in the first two parts, it fails miserably by presenting an inconsistent and corrupt moral system. And because convergent evolution of morality is a natural explanation to the problem of right and wrong, there remains no reason whatsoever for a reasonable person to still want to fill their inner “emptiness” with the mystical solution. Man is good and evil. Man has all the reasons to search for what it and its group perceive as good, even without the mystical way. Man has all the necessary tools to name something right or wrong in itself. And so do some animals.
